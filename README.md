Some deep learning school projects :

- Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is a technique used to visualize and interpret the decisions made by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It highlights the regions of an input image that are most relevant to the model's prediction. Grad-CAM works by computing the gradient of the target class score with respect to the feature maps of a convolutional layer. These gradients are then used to generate a heatmap that shows which parts of the image have the most influence on the final decision. This helps in understanding and explaining the inner workings of CNNs, making them more transparent and interpretable.
